# Classification-with-an-Academic-Success-Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook solution for the Classification with an Academic Success Dataset competition, part of the Tabular Playground Series on Kaggle. The goal of this competition is to predict academic risk of students in higher education.

## About the Tabular Playground Series
The Tabular Playground Series is a collection of machine learning competitions designed to help the Kaggle community learn and sharpen their skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. These competitions typically last a few weeks and feature synthetically generated datasets that mimic real-world data.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of two CSV files: train.csv and test.csv. The train.csv file contains 1460 student records with 15 features, including demographic information, academic performance metrics, and a categorical target variable indicating the academic risk of each student. The test.csv file contains 485 student records with the same features, but without the target variable.

## Solution
The provided Jupyter Notebook (academic-success-eda-ftr-engineering-model.ipynb) contains a step-by-step solution for predicting academic risk using various machine learning algorithms. The notebook covers:

1.Data loading and exploration

2.Feature engineering and preprocessing

3.Model selection and hyperparameter tuning

4.Model evaluation and comparison

5.Final model selection and prediction on the test set
